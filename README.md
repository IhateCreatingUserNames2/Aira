####    AIRA - Agent Interoperability Network
#####  Bridging A2A and MCP for Seamless AI Agent Collaboration
AIRA (AI Resource and Agent Network) enables AI agents built with different frameworks to discover and communicate with each other using a standardized protocol. It bridges the gap between the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a unified ecosystem where AI tools and resources can be shared across different agent implementations.
