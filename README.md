AIRA - Agent Interoperability Network
Bridging A2A and MCP for Seamless AI Agent Collaboration
AIRA (AI Resource and Agent Network) enables AI agents built with different frameworks to discover and communicate with each other using a standardized protocol. It bridges the gap between the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a unified ecosystem where AI tools and resources can be shared across different agent implementations.
