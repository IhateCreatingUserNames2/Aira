CHANGE HUB URL: --hub", default="https://aira-fl8f.onrender.com", help="AIRA Hub URL"

How to Use These Tools 
1. Register a Remote MCP Server
Using the command-line tool:
bash# Register an MCP server with AIRA Hub
python aira_mcp_manager.py register --server https://example.com/mcp-server

# List registered MCP servers
python aira_mcp_manager.py list
Using the web UI:
bash# Start the web UI
python aira_mcp_manager.py webui
Then open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.
2. Start an Adapter Server
If you need to adapt an MCP server to work with the A2A protocol:
bash# Start an adapter server for a specific MCP server
python aira_mcp_manager.py adapter --server https://example.com/mcp-server --port 8080
3. Deploy to Render.com
You can deploy the Web UI to Render.com with these settings:

Create a new Web Service
Use the GitHub repository where you've saved the code
Set the build command to pip install -r requirements.txt
Set the start command to python app.py
Add environment variables:

PORT: 10000 (or whatever port Render.com expects)



Additional Considerations
Authentication
For MCP servers that require authentication (OAuth), you'll need to extend the implementation to:

Store credentials securely
Handle OAuth flows
Refresh tokens as needed

Error Handling
The current implementation has basic error handling. For production use, you should:

Add more detailed error messages
Implement retries for transient errors
Add logging for monitoring

MCP Server Discovery
You could extend the solution to:

Scrape MCP directory websites for known servers
Implement automatic discovery via well-known endpoints
Create a community-maintained registry of verified MCP servers

Conclusion
This implementation provides a comprehensive solution for integrating remote MCP servers with AIRA Hub, allowing:

Registration of remote MCP servers with AIRA Hub
Discovery of MCP server tools
Adapting MCP servers to work with the A2A protocol
A web UI for managing remote MCP servers
